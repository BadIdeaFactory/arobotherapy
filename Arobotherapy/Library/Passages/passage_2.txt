When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take theshape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparentlybeyond the horizon. There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond hisreach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Somehave accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. To the Hebrews it was atoken that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine thatit was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. The Norsemen consideredthe rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in thesky. Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Aristotle thought thatthe rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. Since thenphysicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops whichcauses the rainbows. Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, andthe width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. The actualprimary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number ofbows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to givea bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixedform yellow. This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red andyellow, with little or no green or blue.
